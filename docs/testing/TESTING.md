## Automated Testing

All Python code written for the project has been tested by writing automated unit tests using the testing features implemented in Django and Django Rest Framework ([Testing in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/testing/), [Testing in DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/testing/)).

## Manual Testing

- All API endpoints were manually tested with the browsable API interface with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for the deployed version (the documentation generated by Postman can be found here: [Postman API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33181094/2sA2xb7bFK#intro)).

## PEP 8 Linter

All python code written for the project passes through the PEP 8 [python linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) by Code Institute without issues.
